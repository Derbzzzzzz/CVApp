## docxtemplater

docxtemplater utilizes a template docx file and allows for the document to be customized with an object. The object specifies variable names that are used to fill in the document. Inside the document, one can use loops as well as conditions to help create a more customizable document. More info can be found [here](https://docxtemplater.com).
